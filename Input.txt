
Python 3.x introduced some Python 2-incompatible keywords and features that can be imported via the in-built __future__ module in Python 2. It is recommended to use __future__ imports it if you are planning Python 3.x support for your code.
For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add following import statement
from __future__ import division
